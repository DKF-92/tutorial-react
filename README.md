# Tutorial React

This was a follow along React tutorial, following https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/

### Motivation/Why did you build this project?

This project/tutorial was used to help me ingrain some of the core concepts I learned during the freecodecamp.org's React/Redux course. As that course uses a built in code editor I found it important to start a react app myself from scratch in VSCode and this tutorial served as a nice introduction.

### What problems did you solve?

I mostly used this project as an introduction to using react in VSCode. This tutorial also introduced me to the chrome extension 'React Developer Tools' which i plan on using more in the future

# The following was taken from the original tutorials README file

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
